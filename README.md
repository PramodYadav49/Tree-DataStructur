There is a specific type of tree referred to as a "Binary Tree", which restricts its child nodes to no more than two.

The children of a node are referred to as the "left" node and the "right" node.

When creating a Binary Tree object you'll pass in the first node to become the root node and each node is itself an object with an associated value, along with a left and right node linked to.
